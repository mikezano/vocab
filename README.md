### Why ?

I like playing video games with spanish audio/text and am always picking up on new words as I do.  I figured why not collect them into some app to help me remember them, hence this Vocab app.  Ideally I'd like to get these words from a google translate API that gives me access to my phrasebook but it [doesn't seem like that's possible](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/35902966) ... yet.  For now the google sheet solution works well :)
